            <h1>Bender?! You stole the atom.</h1>
            <p>One hundred dollars. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
            <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I'll get my kit! Leela's gonna kill me. Soothe us with sweet lies. <strong> Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.</strong> <em> $9.</em> 95 a minute.</p>
            <h2>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</h2>
            <p>Look, last night was a mistake. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
            <ol>
            <li>No. We're on the top.</li><li>And I'm his friend Jesus.</li><li>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>No, she'll probably make me do it.</h3>
            <p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You lived before you met me?!</li><li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li><li>One hundred dollars.</li>

            <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Moving alongâ€¦ You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>
            <p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I wish! It's a nickel.</p>
            <p>Hello Morbo, how's the family? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Anyone who laughs is a communist! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?</p>
            <p>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No, I'm Santa Claus! No. We're on the top. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
            <p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal!</p>
            <aside>
              <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Large bet on myself in round one.</p>
            </aside>
            <p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
            <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Is that a cooking show? Then we'll go with that data file! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>
            <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Large bet on myself in round one. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. File not found. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
            <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? And until then, I can never die? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</p>
            <p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Hello Morbo, how's the family? What are their names? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
